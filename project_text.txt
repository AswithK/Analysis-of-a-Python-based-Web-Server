 
A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 
The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.
HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data over the web. Stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." 
It is part of the Internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for transmitting webpage data.
HTTP uses a server-client model.
A client, for example, may be a home computer, laptop, or mobile deviceAs a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers.
HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.
HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
Anatomy of an HTTP request
A request line.
A set of header fields.
A body, which is optional.
An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).
An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
A webserver in Python can be setup in two ways. Python supports a webserver out of the box. 
You can start a web server with a one liner. But you can also create a custom web server which has unique functionality.
